Welcome to my website! I am Katja, an Assistant Professor in the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/physics) at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/).

I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum many-body systems. More specifically, I am interested in non-equilibrium phenomena, both in the classical, and quantum setting. I find this field fascinating, as it poses what is still one of the big open questions of modern theoretical physics: the emergence of macroscopic laws from microscopic dynamics. My work is mostly analytical, and combines ideas of statistical mechanics, quantum information, integrablity, and mathematical physics.
