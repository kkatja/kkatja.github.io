I am Katja, an Assistant Professor in the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/physics) at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). Welcome to my website!

I am a theoretical physicist working on non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body systems. The broad fundamental underlying questions I am trying to approach are concerned with finding an efficient description of emergent large-scale behaviour of quantum (or classical) systems consisting of many interacting particles. My work is mostly analytical, and combines ideas of statistical mechanics, quantum information, integrablity, and mathematical physics.
